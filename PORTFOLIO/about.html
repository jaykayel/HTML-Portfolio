                Hello, my name is John. Maybe you will think I'm a native english person but I'm not. I was born in germany and life here with my russian parents. You didn't expect that did you?
                I life in germany since i was born and can speak:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>German</li>
                <li>Russian</li>
                <li>English</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I graduated "Realschule" back in 2015 and was fascinated in computers since i was in class 7. Back in those days my fascination was locked on cybersecurity and hacking.
                But times has changed and my interests are not the same as then. My interests today are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cybersecurity</li>
                <li>Web Development</li>
                <li>Networking</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Since Cybersecurity has always been relevant for me this point hasn't changed yet. Web Development is the path I have choosen now and I'm working on improving my Skills with new challanges as you 
                can see on this Homepage. Currently I have only HTML, CSS and python skills which I am able to use with success. By the way: this is my very first Webpage I've built so I would really like to get 
                honest feedback about it in the contact section. Alternatively you can click <a href="mailto:beruf.john@gmail.com"><strong>here</strong></a>.
