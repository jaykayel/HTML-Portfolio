                        <p>I learned everything I know about Batch by myself. I can use the windows command prompt to show computer and network analyses and modify them with succes. My favorite project was to get into a windows machine withput the password.</p>
                    <li>Python (Advanced)</li>
                        <p>Currently still learning Python programming language. I already did get Certificates for my basic and advanced python skills on ProgrammingHub. You can also check my Github for projects I finished on my road to Python developer. I have chosen the path to get a python developer on Jetbrains Academy which is linked in the social media section. I look forward to get in Machine Learning and Django Web development.</p>
                    <li>HTML5 (Fundamental)</li>
