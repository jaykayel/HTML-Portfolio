    // currently in duscussion with myself about the navigation menu...
    // i want it to be in a block like buttons                                 <- Hotbar
    // it then should be on the very bottom of the picture
    // the name schould be over it with a total of 20px over the menu.
    // over it the prtpic is placed

    // 1. place the navigation elements in a Hotbar which is at the very bottom of the elpic element.
    // 1.1 Create a Hotbar Element and design it.               <- Only css needed
    // there i created a block with lightblue color which is used as a 
    // hotbar. when on hover: the background changes color to rgb(101, 145, 160)
    // if active the background color gets same color as on hover.
    // the font size is 20px ehich looks okay under the 36px name
    // all thats left is to place the hotbar in the elpic element.

    // 1.2 Place the navigation elements in the Hotbar.
    // already had them in but this was a opportunity to check it

    // 1.3 place the Hotbar under the elpic element 
    // I will now change the size of the prtpic so it isn't that huge
    
    // 2. Place the name element over the Hotbar
    // Did it 
    // 3. Place the prtpic element 20px over the name element 
    // we don#t need it bcs the background is ne in a smaler dimension

    // Now that I added a Hotbar element and placed everything I needed
    // I can focus on the Style of the hotbar
    
    // 1. Design the Hotbar 
    // This should be enough for now. I will upload the project to github
    // then i will do more things on this project :D


    //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // NEXT STEPS
    // 1. Create a new HTML File "About me" and link it to the Hotbar.
    // CHECK
    // 1.1 Add text about me and place some images in it.
    // 1.2 make it look fancy so it dosn't look boring

    // 2. Create a new HTML File "Languages" and link it to the Hotbar.
    // CHECK
    // 2.1 Add text about me and place some images in it.
    // 2.2 make it look fancy so it dosn't look boring
    
    // 3. Create a new HTML File "Links" and link it to the Hotbar.
    // CHECK
    // 3.1 Add text about me and place some images in it.
    // 3.2 make it look fancy so it dosn't look boring

    // 4. Create a new HTML File "Contact" and link it to the Hotbar.
    // CHECK
    // 4.1 Add text about me and place some images in it.
    // 4.2 make it look fancy so it dosn't look boring

    // 26.11.2020
    // I found a wiki like site where i get detailed information about
    // thematics i need to know about

    // And btw i now can use all 10 fingers again.
    // If you didn't know i had a broken finger now i can use it again :D

    // So what i was looking for was the hotbar. I created it but wasn't sure
    // if i did it right. so i decided to get it right. I use the website explained earlier
    // Its URL:
    // https://www.w3.org/
    // And now I'm going to style my code :D

    // There we are... i need to change the div to nav and rewrite the code since I need
    // to edit the stylesheet too...

    // now that i deleted the id of hotbar and replacced the div to nav i onlyx needed
    // to change the CSS code which was standing for the hotbar.
    // now there is n longer an id of hotbar, only class hotbar for future porpuses :D

    // this links are dead :(
    // but that dosn't matter bcs the theory without examples can be enough maybe...
    // the next thing i do is to change the anchor elements to a list so the code format is 
    // like it should be
    // this does not look good
    // i see my mistake.. i need to put the anchor elements inside the list element
    // so the link funktion works
    // thanks that Stackoverflow exists :D 
    // tot better viualize myproblem i now have added a black background
    // i just need to print the list horizontal instead of vertical
    // now i need to set the bottom margin and padding of elpic to 0px
    // and the top margin and padding also
    // maybei should also change the class active color something different 
    // currently it is  #7f8c8d maybe i can find a color which gives a good contrast to the background
    // maybe i can get it darker myself... no i don't have the pacience 

    // I touched the keybord wrong with my finger it hurt a little ...
    // yes with the broken one
    // You can check out my Discord if you want there is noone except me until later
    //              discord.gg/EPWxZpuhyg
    // want to make some screenshots so i can upload them on the website

    // 5. Fill the page with content so it isn't taht empty
