    // currently in duscussion with myself about the navigation menu...
    // i want it to be in a block like buttons                                 <- Hotbar
    // it then should be on the very bottom of the picture
    // the name schould be over it with a total of 20px over the menu.
    // over it the prtpic is placed

    // 1. place the navigation elements in a Hotbar which is at the very bottom of the elpic element.
    // 1.1 Create a Hotbar Element and design it.               <- Only css needed
    // there i created a block with lightblue color which is used as a 
    // hotbar. when on hover: the background changes color to rgb(101, 145, 160)
    // if active the background color gets same color as on hover.
    // the font size is 20px ehich looks okay under the 36px name
    // all thats left is to place the hotbar in the elpic element.

    // 1.2 Place the navigation elements in the Hotbar.
    // already had them in but this was a opportunity to check it

    // 1.3 place the Hotbar under the elpic element 
    // I will now change the size of the prtpic so it isn't that huge
    
    // 2. Place the name element over the Hotbar
    // Did it 
    // 3. Place the prtpic element 20px over the name element 
    // we don#t need it bcs the background is ne in a smaler dimension
