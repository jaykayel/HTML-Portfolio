            <h2>Official homepage of John Klein</h2>
            <p>
                Hello there. This is my Official homepage where I will show you who I am and what i do. If you are from
                a company I can recomend you to visit the "Languages" Tab.
                You can either find it in the Navigation menu or you can click
                <a href="languages.html"><strong>here</strong></a>.
            </p>
            <img id="codepic" src="media/pictures/links-shot.png" title="links-shot" alt="A picture of my code in my IDE" height="60%" width="60%">
            <h2>What do you see above?</h2>
            <p>
                Let me explain what you can see in the picture above. You can see the actual HTML document of the
                "Links" Tab where i first titled the Tab with "Links"
                and then linked my CSS stylesheet to the HTML file. This was declared to the head of the document.
                After that I created 3 divisions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>ID top</strong></li>
                <p>This division is set to be on top of the page and has its text align on center</p>
                <li><strong>Division class elpic</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Here i declared "class" elpic to the division to get a background. I could also do it with a ID but I
                    did this for future purposes.
                </p>
                <li><strong>Division "class" name</strong></li>
                <p>In this step i declared a style class to the name you can see in the elpic.</p>
                <li><strong>Navigation bar aka Hotbar</strong></li>
                <p>
                Then it's starting to get interesting: The navigation bar aka Hotbar. Here I set an ordered list and put
                links in the anchor elements to navigate through the Website.
                The hotbar buttons have different styles which I declared trough IDs. The "class" element "active" is set
                to the open tab so you can see it in the hotbar.
                </p>
                <li><strong>Links and descriptions</strong></li>
                <p>
                    Here it's starting to get easier and more copy & paste likely. First I declared the "id" social to
                    the element which shows you the buttons and the descriptions of them. Then I added buttons to this
                    part of the page which I designed in the CSS stylesheet which is linked above. To this buttons I
                    linked the pages which are described in the "p" (paragraphs) under the "buttons".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be honest to yourself and tell me if you saw the mistake with the stylesheet link ;D
                </p>
            </ol>
